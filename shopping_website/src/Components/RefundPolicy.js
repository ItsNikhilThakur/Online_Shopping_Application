      We have a 3-day return policy, which means you have 3 days after receiving your item to request 
      a return.

      To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.

     To start a return, you can go to ‘My Order’ section. If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a notification for it. The refund will be processed only if the product meets our eligibility criteria. You can always contact us for any return query at talk2me@skybags.co.in or Call on support number 022-41724444
